# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
# from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# How do I check for a palindrome? Abuse the text reverse feature?
# How do i efficiently multiply all the things?
