### LongJacket PWA
Patrol and incident accountability solution for guard personnel at remote facilities. **Currently in development**

#### Minimum Goal:
Allow guard personnel to receive patrol orders and submit verifiable photographic proof of work along the patrol path.
- Patrol orders are received as push notifications
  - patrol path and proof-of-work waypoint coordinates included in orders.
- Photo geotagging is used in validating proof of work

#### Greater Goals:
- Allow personnel to document an incident during patrols and submit photographic evidence.
- Capture location data passively between waypoints to aid in verifying spot-check claims.
