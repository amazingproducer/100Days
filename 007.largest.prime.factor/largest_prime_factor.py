# The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
# What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

# Ugh. Prime numbers. How do I even start? Let's consider what makes a natural
# number prime: its factors. Prime numbers have only two factors: 1 and the
# number itself. What's an efficient way of determining a number is prime?

# Do I use the silly rules I learned in grade school? Like:
#   "A number is not prime if it is even."
#   "A number is not prime if it ends in 5."
#   "A number is not prime if its digits are divisible by 3"
#   "Aside from 2 and 5, a prime number must end in 1, 3, 7, or 9"

# How do I efficiently determine a number's factors?
# Should such a general approach be used to solve this specific problem?

# Should I first build a set of primes and check each of the nearest primes to
# the target number are factors of the target number? Or should I start from
# the furthest ones?
