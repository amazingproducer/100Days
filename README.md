2019 Attempt at 100 Days of Coding Challenge

My goal is to use this repository to demonstrate progress in programmatic
problem solving, test-driven development, maintaining a public repository, and
managing a short-term project over a 100 day period. I aim to devote two or 
more hours of each day to this endeavor.

Progress may be tracked via the [Exercises](https://github.com/amazingproducer/100Days/projects/1) Project.

Exercises are in directories organized by starting day and the exercise name.

During these 100 days, exercise suggestions may be submitted as an [issue](https://github.com/amazingproducer/100Days/issues).
